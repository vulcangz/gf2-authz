# gf2-authz - GoFrame v2 + GORM + React + Material UI

gf2-auth is a fork of [eko/authz](https://github.com/eko/authz), Backend with GoFrame instead of Fiber, frontend migrated from react-scripts to Vite.

This project brings a backend server with its frontend for managing authorizations.

You can use both Role-Based Acccess Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

## Why use it?

üåç  A centralized backend for all your applications authorizations

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

üìå  Supports Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

‚öôÔ∏è   Go SDKs available

‚úÖ  Reliable: Authz uses Authz itself for managing its own internal authorizations

üîç  Audit: We log each check decisions and which policy matched

üîê  Single Sign-On: Use your enterprise SSO to log into the web UI, using OpenID Connect

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Observability: Retrieve metrics and tracing data into your prefered tools

## SDKs

In order to help you, we have the following available SDKs:

- [Go](https://github.com/vulcangz/gf2-authz/tree/main/pkg/sdk)
- [blog example](https://github.com/vulcangz/gf2-authz/tree/main/examples/blog)

Please check their documentations for detailled usage. They all use `gRPC` for communicating with the Authz backend (server-to-server).

## Getting started

To get started with this project, run

### Running with default config

No configuration is required. 

#### STEP 1: Backend

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vulcangz/gf2-authz.git
  cd gf2-authz
  go mod tidy
  go run main.go
```

The system then runs with the default config, using SQLite in-memory database.



#### STEP 2: Admin Dashboard(UI)

```bash
  cd ui
  pnpm i
  pnpm dev
```

visiting http://localhost:3000

Sign in with default credentials: `admin` / `changeme`.

#### STEP 3: Examples blog

1. Create a service account under menu `Service accounts` in dashboard.
2. Edit [main.go](https://github.com/vulcangz/gf2-authz/blob/main/examples/blog/main.go#L18-L19). Replace the `client_id`, `client_secret` which obtained in the previous step.
3. Edit the principal(name: `auth-sa-(your service account name)`). Assign a role(`authz-admin`) to it.
4. Run the test:
```
go run main.go
```
5. visiting [metrics api](http://localhost:8080/v1/metrics) for Prometheus metrics observability(default config: disable). 

### Running with your config

Save [example config](https://github.com/vulcangz/gf2-authz/blob/main/manifest/config/config.example.yaml) as `config.yaml`. Edit it with your config.

Then, same steps as above.


that's all you need to get started!
